This project is designed to ask the user what the capital is for the listed country. This list of countries and their 
capitals are being taken from the Postgres SQL database which I have created using pgadmin. The purpose of this project 
was for me to further my knowledge and practice using css, javascript, node, and SQL databases. 

The prompt for this project was given to me from an online course I am taking on my own time, so I was able to be assisted
when needed.
