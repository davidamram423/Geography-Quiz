This project is designed to ask the user what the capital is for the listed country. If the user 
enters the correct answer, their score will be increased by 1. If the user enters the wrong answer,
they will receive an alert stating that they entered the wrong answer, and receive their final score.

This list of countries and their capitals are being taken from the Postgres SQL database which I 
have created using pgadmin. The purpose of this project was for me to further my knowledge and 
practice using css, javascript, node, and SQL databases. 

The prompt for this project was given to me from an online course I am taking on my own time, so I was able to be assisted
when needed.
